# Unsupervised Invariant Risk Minimization
This repository contains the code for replicating the experimental results in the "Unsupervised Invariant Risk Minimization" paper.

There are three directories:
1. PICA, with the code for the experiment in section 3.1 in the paper.
2. VIAE_SMNIST, with the code for sections 4.3-4.5 for the SMNIST dataset, including pretrained parameters for time saving.
3. VIAE_CMNIST, with the code for sections 4.3-4.5 for the SCMNIST dataset, including pretrained parameters for time saving.
